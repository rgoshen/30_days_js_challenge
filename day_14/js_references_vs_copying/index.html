      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      // let age = 47;
      // let age2 = age;

      // console.log(age, age2);

      // age = 80;
      // console.log(age, age2);

      // let name = "Rick";
      // let name2 = name;

      // console.log(name, name2);

      // name = "Hung";
      // console.log(name, name2);

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      // const team = players;

      // console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // team[3] = "Lux";
      // console.log(players, team);

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      // one way
      // const team2 = players.slice();
      // console.log(players, team2);
      // team2[3] = "Lux";
      // console.log(players, team2);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      // const team3 = [].concat(players);
      // console.log(players, team3);
      // team3[3] = "Rick";
      // console.log(players, team3);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      // const team4 = [...players];
      // console.log(players, team4);
      // team4[3] = "Hung";
      // console.log(players, team4);

      // const team5 = Array.from(players);
      // console.log(players, team5);
      // team5[3] = "new";
      // team5[4] = "me";
      // console.log(players, team5);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const captain = person;
      // console.log(person, captain);
      // captain.number = 99;
      // console.log(person, captain);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
      console.log(person, captain2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both
      // for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method,
      // but you should think twice before using it.

      // not recommended but can do this for deep copy or
      // find on the web a deep clone function
      const dev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
